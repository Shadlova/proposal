% template for a task
% each task should be added to exactly one workpackage
% in the workpackage task list
\begin{task}[
  title=Online resources for open science,

  lead=INSERM,
  PM=14,
  wphases={0-48},
  partners={CDS,EP,QS,SIL,SRL,UPSUD,WTT,XFEL}
]
  The task includes the following activities
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item The interactive book on applied Stochastic processes in Physics. Unlike classical books in this subject, it will be supplemented by numerical examples of solving real case problems. We will emphasize the
role of high performance computing in solving problems modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDE). Materials will contain examples of using GPU computing in solving SDE. The deliverable of this part will be available via the EOSC hub, and will use HPC hardware available. (\localdelivref{sde-book})
