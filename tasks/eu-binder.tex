  The purpose of this task is to create a community of practice of BinderHub
  operators and operate a European Binder instance.

  Re-executing the code associated with all European Open Access publications
  requires a very large amount of very diverse compute resources. It is
  unrealistic that one BinderHub instance could provide all of these. This is
  why in this task we will work on building a community of practice around
  operating public Binder instances at a research institution.

  Constraints from data protection and privacy mean not all code supporting a
  publication can be made public and/or that data can not be moved outside of
  the EU. This task will work on operating a EU based Binder instance accessible
  to the public. This will mirror the current mybinder.org but be hosted in
  the EU. This European Binder instance will serve as the first partner in the
  global federation of Binder instances.


  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Build a community of practice of BinderHub operators. Create a forum
  for Binder operators to exchange experience and tools.

  \item Operate a Binder instance hosted in Europe.

  \item Develop a federation of Binder instances and produce a report on best
    practices for coordinating several federated BinderHub instances across
    institutes.
